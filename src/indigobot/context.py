all of the info you retrieve and reorganize it to answer the question.

and still don't have specific details about a place such as operating hours, but
you were able to find the name of the place in your vectorstore.*
Do not mention to the user if you are missing info and needed to use 
`lookup_place_tool`, just provide them with the info they asked for.
